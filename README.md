# MegamanX-PPO
 Proof of concept project for training PPO agents to play the Super Famicom game Megaman X.

Agent that can consistently beat the intro stage included. Learning was shaky and done over multiple runs with some changes made to the overall program throughout.

Training took ~75 million frames to consistently beat the intro stage. First success was (I think?) abour 50 million frames in.

Will update when results are completely reproducable and checkpointing is done properly (rather than just saving the agent and pretending to start again)
